Udemy - A Beginner's Guide To Machine Learning with Unity

Course Description
What if you could build a character that could learn while it played?  Think about the types of game play you could develop where the enemies started to outsmart the player. This is what machine learning in games is all about. In this course we will discover the fascinating world of artificial intelligence beyond the simple stuff and examine the increasingly popular domain of machines that learn to think for themselves.

In this course, Penny introduces the popular machine learning techniques of genetic algorithms and neural networks using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and knowledge from a Ph.D in game character AI and over 25 years experience working with games and computer graphics.  In addition she's written two award winning books on games AI and two others best sellers on Unity game development. Through-out the course you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to teach you about the fundamental machine learning techniques distilling the mathematics in a way that the topic becomes accessible to the most noob of novices.
